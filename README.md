# Encrypting-and-decrypting-of-a-python-file

Encrypting a Python file involves converting the content of the file into a format that is unreadable and can only be decrypted by authorized parties. There are various encryption algorithms and libraries available in Python that can be used to encrypt a Python file. 

Here are in the steps involved in encrypting a file using python.

1) Choose an encryption algorithm: There are several encryption algorithms available, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and Blowfish, among others. Choose an encryption algorithm that meets your security requirements.

2) Install the encryption library: Depending on the encryption algorithm you choose, you may need to install a Python library that provides the implementation for that algorithm. For example, if you choose AES, you can use the "pycryptodome" library, and you can install it using pip with the command: pip install pycryptodome.

3) Import the encryption library: Import the encryption library in your Python script or program using the import statement. For example, if you're using the "pycryptodome" library for AES encryption, you can import it as follows: from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES.

4) Open the file to be encrypted: Open the Python file that you want to encrypt using the built-in open() function in Python. You can specify the file mode as "rb" (read binary) to ensure that you read the file as binary data.

5) Read the file content: Read the content of the file using the read() method, and store it in a variable.

6) Encrypt the file content: Use the encryption algorithm from the chosen library to encrypt the file content. The exact steps and parameters for encryption may vary depending on the algorithm and library used. For example, if you're using AES encryption with the "pycryptodome" library, you can create an AES cipher object, specify the encryption mode, and use it to encrypt the file content.

7) Write the encrypted content to a new file: Create a new file to store the encrypted content using the open() function with a "wb" (write binary) file mode. Write the encrypted content to the new file using the write() method.

8) Close the files: Close both the input file and the output file using the close() method to ensure that all changes are saved.
